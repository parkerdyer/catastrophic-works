I've given a few lightning talks on this subject and figured I'd share it here. The tiny kitten above has worked very hard on this presentation. Kudos to her.

I hope you're as excited as I am to learn about Konami code. And cats!

Game developer Kazuhisa Hasimoto was a Konami employee working on the development of the Gradius arcade game in 1986. He didn't want to test every level every time, so he created a cheat code for himself for testing purposes only. But he forgot to remove the code before the game went to production.

<small><i>Like this cat, Konami code hides in the background. (Just kidding, this is a terrible analogy. I can see that cat very clearly. It's not even trying to hide.)</i></small>
