I've given a few lightning talks on this subject and figured I'd share it here.

You may be asking yourself, "What do cats have to do with Konami code?" The answer is: absolutely nothing. Enjoy!

Game developer Kazuhisa Hasimoto was a Konami employee working on the development of the Gradius arcade game in 1986. He didn't want to test every level every time something changed in a higher level, so he created a cheat code for himself for testing purposes only. But he forgot to remove the code before the game went to production.
